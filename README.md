# Recruit Laicaille Administrator

`v1.0.0` for Starsector `0.98a-RC8`, made using [Wisp's IntelliJ Mod Template](https://github.com/wispborne/Starsector-IntelliJ-Template)

## Description

A small mod that adds dialogue choices to the administrator of the Laicaille Habitat after they're dismissed, to allow you to recruit them yourself.

## Installation

Download the latest `.zip` from the [Releases list](https://github.com/smangham/starsector-recruit-laicaille/releases),
extract to the `starsector-recruit-laicaille` directory, and place it in your `starsector/mods` directory then check it in the launcher.

## Usage

Visit Laicaille Habitat after completing **Finding Coureuse**, and talk to the dismissed former administrator.
Once you've completed the first discussion with them, you'll then be able to start a new conversation about recruitment.
